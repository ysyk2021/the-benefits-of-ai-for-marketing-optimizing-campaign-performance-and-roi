What is Predictive Analytics?
-----------------------------

Predictive analytics involves using statistical models and machine learning algorithms to analyze data and predict future outcomes. In marketing, predictive analytics can be used to identify high-value segments, optimize pricing and promotions, and improve customer retention.

Traditionally, predictive analytics has been done manually, using basic criteria such as demographics or purchase history. However, this approach is limited in its effectiveness and can leave valuable insights undiscovered.
